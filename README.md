JavaAtlas — A Complete Codebase of Core-to-Advanced Topics

Wander through Java’s wilds — from the hush of Hello World to the thunder of concurrent storms.

A single repository that holds Java’s stories: small, focused examples you can run, learn from, and build upon. Each file is a lantern — clear, runnable, and written to teach.

🔖 Short Description

A complete Java repository covering basics to advanced topics: OOP, collections, streams, generics, concurrency, I/O, JDBC, Spring Boot, design patterns & more — with structured, runnable examples.

📚 Topics Covered

Basics: syntax, control flow, classes, methods

OOP: inheritance, interfaces, records, sealed types

Collections & Generics: List, Set, Map, wildcards, bounds

Functional: lambdas, method references, Optional

Streams: map / filter / reduce, collectors, parallel streams

Concurrency: Thread, ExecutorService, CompletableFuture, locks

I/O & NIO.2: files, paths, channels, async I/O

Networking: sockets, HTTP client examples

Persistence: JDBC examples, connection pooling, basic DAO

Serialization: Jackson, Gson, JAXB examples

Testing: JUnit 5, Mockito examples

Design Patterns: Builder, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Singleton

Spring Boot: tiny REST apps, validation, profiles

Security: password hashing, JWT intro

Tools: JMH microbenchmarks, basic performance notes

✨ Example Snippet

Every example is minimal and runnable. Look inside src/main/java for focused classes such as:

functional.optionals.OptionalBasics — safe transformations with Optional.

concurrency.futures.FutureIntro — basic CompletableFuture composition.

Each file shows input, output and a short explanation in comments.

🛠 How to Add an Example

Create a new package under src/main/java/<topic>.

Add a single-purpose class with a main method.

Add a matching unit test under src/test/java.

Add a 2–5 line README in the topic folder if needed.

Open a PR: feat/<topic>-short-description.

Guidelines:

Keep examples small and single-responsibility.

Use descriptive names and add comments that explain the why, not just the how.

Follow a consistent formatter (Spotless or Google Java Style recommended).

🤝 Contributing
